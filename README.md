## Description

Stone is a backend framework for Deno. It features a simple, fast, and lightweight web framework, Our focus is to
deliver as many tools as possible so you can build applications in record time.

Under the hood, Stone uses [Hono](https://hono.dev/) and [AtlasSDK](https://deno.land/x/atlas_sdk@v1).

## Philosophy

I recently migrated to the Deno ecosystem, and I missed a framework that would allow me to create small applications,
APIs or simple functions as quickly as I could do in Node with the entire existing ecosystem.

The idea of this framework is not to copy cool and well-established things like NestJS, I just want to have something
that allows me to deliver code quickly, with as little effort as possible and without losing performance. So expect
things like: generic repository implementations and abstractions for controllers and services.
